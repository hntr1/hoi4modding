# Decisions
  activate_volksstrum: "Führerbefehle 69"
  activate_volksstrum_desc: "Experience in the east has shown that Volkssturm, emergency and reserve units have little fighting value when left to themselves, and can be quickly destroyed. The fighting value of these units, which are for the most part strong in numbers, but weak in the armaments required for modern battle, is immeasurably higher when the go into action with troops of the regular army in the field. I, therefore, order where Volkssturm, emergency, and reserve units are available, together with regular units, in any battle sector, mixed battlegroups (Brigades) will be formed under unified command, so as to give the Volkssturm, emergency, and reserve units stiffening and support. - Adolf Hitler"

  deploy_reserve_armories_desc: "Our shortage in equipment can be alleviated by issuing old stockpiles from the Great War"
  
  nero_decree: "Führerbefehle 71"
  nero_decree_desc: "It is a mistake to think that transport and communication facilities, industrial establishments and supply depots, which have not been destroyed, or have only been temporarily put out of action, can be used again for our own ends when the lost territory has been recovered. The enemy will leave us nothing but scorched earth when he withdraws, without paying the slightest regard to the population. I therefore order all military transport and communication facilities, industrial establishments and supply depots, as well as anything else of value within Reich territory, which could be used by the enemy immediately or within the foreseeable future for the prosecution of the war, will be destroyed. - Adolf Hitler"

They will ensure that the enemy does not occupy these areas of decisive operational importance. They will allow themselves to be surrounded, thereby holding down the largest possible number of enemy forces, and establishing conditions favorable for successful counterattacks. Local Strongpoints are strongpoints deep in the battle area, which will be tenaciously defended in the event of enemy penetration. By being included in the main line of battle, they will act as a reserve of defence and, should the enemy break through, as hinges and cornerstones for the Front, forming positions from which counterattacks can be launched. Each Fortified Area Commandant should be a specially selected, hardened soldier, preferably of General's rank. He will be appointed by the Army Group concerned. Fortified Area Commandants will be personally responsible to the Commander in Chief of the Army Group. Fortified Area Commandants will pledge their honor as soldiers to carry out their duties to the last. - Adolf Hitler"
